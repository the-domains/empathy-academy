  Not all creative insights are useful. For instance, if you decided to design a
  four-story car with one wheel, no one would deny that the invention is
  creative, but it's not likely to be hailed as the next big thing in
  transportation. Creativity needs to be informed by real perspectives and
  grounded in a real-world context.
