  Empathy is the experience of understanding another person's condition from
  their perspective. You place yourself in their shoes and feel what they are
  feeling. Empathy is known to increase prosocial (helping) behaviors. While
  American culture might be socializing people into becoming more
  individualistic rather than empathic, research has uncovered the existence of
  "mirror neurons," which react to emotions expressed by others and then
  reproduce them.
