      Influential people have a profound impact on everyone they encounter. Yet,
      they achieve this only because they exert so much influence inside, on
      themselves. We see only their outside. We see them innovate, speak their
      mind, and propel themselves forward toward bigger and better things. And,
      yet, we're missing the best part.

  Empathy is a key element of Emotional Intelligence. It establishes the link
  between self and others as it is how we as individuals understand what others
  are experiencing. Researchers generally define empathy as the ability to sense
  other people's emotions, coupled with the ability to imagine what someone else
  might be thinking of or feeling.
