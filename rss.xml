            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Denmark has figured out how to teach kids empathy and make them happier adults</h1><p>Empathy, or the ability to read another person's emotions, is a critical life skill. Many fear children are losing it-and that they'll be less happy as adults as a result. A University of Michigan study of nearly 14,000 college students found that students today have about 40% less empathy than college kids had in the...</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/1841a7b29443afc3ede5031a43e5d3f9/noop.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fi0.wp.com%2Fqzprod.files.wordpress.com%2F2016%2F08%2Fap_156710622210.jpg%3Ffit%3D440%252C330%26ssl%3D1"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Why Empathy Is the Key to Being More Creative</h1><p>Not all creative insights are useful. For instance, if you decided to design a four-story car with one wheel, no one would deny that the invention is creative, but it's not likely to be hailed as the next big thing in transportation. Creativity needs to be informed by real perspectives and grounded in a real-world context.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/642c356877a3b370fbe14cba4e5ee36f/noop?input=http%3A%2F%2Fcdn2.hubspot.net%2Fhubfs%2F53%2F%255BAgency_Post%255D%2FBlog_Images%2Fsubrosa-empathy.png%23keepProtocol"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The power of empathy</h1><p>Empathy is a key element of Emotional Intelligence. It establishes the link between self and others as it is how we as individuals understand what others are experiencing. Researchers generally define empathy as the ability to sense other people's emotions, coupled with the ability to imagine what someone else might be thinking of or feeling.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/f55a9e77767951d7bffaa2f33419078b/noop.jpg?input=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thefinancialexpress-bd.com%2Fassets%2Fimages%2Fnews_images%2F2016%2F08%2F26%2Fthumbnails%2Fempathy-1_43542.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Empathy | Psychology Today</h1><p>Empathy is the experience of understanding another person's condition from their perspective. You place yourself in their shoes and feel what they are feeling. Empathy is known to increase prosocial (helping) behaviors. While American culture might be socializing people into becoming more individualistic rather than empathic, research has uncovered the existence of "mirror neurons," which react to emotions expressed by others and then reproduce them.</p><img src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/9a1006bd938a2aa870a3ed77f5081dcb/noop.png?input=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.psychologytoday.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fstyles%2Fprofile%2Fpublic%2Ffield_magazine_cover%2F2016-07-05.png%3Fitok%3DePPPBJq_"></article>]]></description>
